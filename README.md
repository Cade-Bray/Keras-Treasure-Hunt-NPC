### Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
During this project I was given templates for the jupyter notebook and the environment for an intelligent agent to work within. The actual implementation of the agent was left to me to construct. This included training methods, model structures (i.e. layers and activations), and even training data convulsions.

### Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
* What do computer scientists do and why does it matter? How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?


Computer scientists work in almost every field in this modern age. Computer scientists are first and foremost problem solves that have been various technologies as their tools within their toolbox. It matters what computer scientists do because without a firm understanding of availables tools in an industry we wouldn't see such large effenciency increases that we enjoy today. Approaching issues as a computer scientist means breaking down issues into logical components and grouping characteristics to be built as modular components for reuse. Computer scientists further optimize issues by thinking of the issue algorithmically. This algorithmic thinking includes creating design patterns, data structures, and architecture that naturally solve the issue instead of brute forcing solutions through pessimal avenues.

* What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?


My ethical responsibilities to the end user and organization may be different at times. For the end user I must commit myself to understanding their needs and ensuring that a system isn't released without considerable testing. Additionally, an end user may not understand how AI can come to some conclusions and need to be educated. This education is important because it shows the user they still need to be in control of the solution and double check its work. For an organization my responibilities include protecting them from as much liability as possible while balancing the profitability.
